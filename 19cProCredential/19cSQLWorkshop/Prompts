Overall: solid, well‑organized set of lesson notes that cover core topics (fundamentals, joins, group functions, subqueries, set operators, DML). Below are concise, actionable suggestions to make the docs stronger for study and practice.

Strengths

Good topic coverage for an introductory-to-intermediate course.
Clear examples for most concepts (joins, aggregates, subqueries, set ops, DML).
Oracle‑specific syntax and cross‑DB notes included in places.
High‑impact suggestions

Add a single course index (SQL_Course_Notes.md / course-overview.md) with links to each lesson and last‑updated timestamps so navigation is easy.
Provide a sample schema + seed data script (CREATE TABLE + INSERTs) in the repo so readers can run examples end‑to‑end.
Add exercises and answers for each lesson (beginner → advanced) and small quizzes to test comprehension.
Include expected output for key examples (a few rows) so learners can verify results quickly.
Add an “EXPLAIN/Execution plan” section with examples (Oracle: EXPLAIN PLAN / DBMS_XPLAN, MySQL: EXPLAIN) for join/aggregate queries to teach performance thinking.
Add a short SQL style / formatting guide and naming conventions used across docs (aliases, capitalization, indentation).
Add common pitfalls and gotchas (NULL with NOT IN, COUNT vs COUNT(*), GROUP BY rules, implicit commits on DDL, data type mismatches).
Add a chapter or appendix on window/analytic functions and basic indexing & constraints (primary/foreign/indexes) — very useful for intermediate learners.
Ensure each doc states DB compatibility and flags Oracle‑specific syntax vs ANSI (e.g., MINUS vs EXCEPT, NVL vs COALESCE).
Provide a “cheat sheet” PDF or single page with common commands and syntax.
Add visual aids: simple ER diagrams for schema used in examples and diagrams for join types and execution order (WHERE→GROUP BY→HAVING→ORDER BY).
Maintenance & repo hygiene

Keep Last Updated consistent across files; consider a changelog or commit reference.
Standardize filenames and headings (prefix with two‑digit lesson number, you already do that — keep in every file).
Consider a tests/verify folder with SQL scripts that run against a sample DB (or instructions to run via Docker/Oracle XE).
Optional extras (nice to have)

Add answers as collapsible sections or separate “solutions” files.
Add performance recipes (rewrite correlated subqueries as joins, use analytic functions instead of complex joins).
Add links to further reading: Oracle docs, SQL style guides, explain plan tutorials.
Add a short section on tools (SQL*Plus, SQL Developer, SQLcl, DBeaver) and how to run the provided scripts on Windows.
If you want, I can:

Generate a sample schema + INSERT script placed in c:\Users\fry\Documents\repos\OracleUniversity\19cProCredential\19cSQLWorkshop\sample_schema.sql
Add an exercises + solutions file per lesson (example format)
Produce a one‑page cheat sheet Markdown file
Which of the above should I create first?

GPT-5 mini • 1x

These 10 AI prompts replaced my entire study routine (and saved me a lot of money)
After burning through subscription after subscription, I realized I was paying for what AI could do better.

So I ditched the apps and turned Claude/ChatGPT into my personal learning assistant.

The results? I've mastered more skills in 6 weeks than I did in 6 months of traditional methods.

Here are 10 AI prompts that transformed how I learn everything from coding to cooking.

Copy these and watch your progress explode 📈

1. The Deep Dive Explainer:

"Break down [complex topic] like I'm 12, then gradually increase complexity over 5 levels until I reach expert understanding."

2. Mistake Prevention System:

"List the 10 most common mistakes beginners make with [skill/topic]. For each, give me a simple check to avoid it."

3. Learning Path Architect:

"Create a step-by-step roadmap to master [skill] in [timeframe]. Include milestones, resources, and weekly goals."

4. The Analogy Machine:

"Explain [difficult concept] using 3 different analogies from [sports/cooking/movies]. Make it impossible to forget."

5. Practice Problem Generator:

"Give me 5 progressively harder practice problems for [topic]. Include hints and detailed solutions."

6. Real-World Connector:

"Show me 7 ways [concept I'm learning] applies to everyday situations. Use specific examples I can relate to."

7. Knowledge Gap Hunter:

"Quiz me on [subject] with 10 questions. Based on my answers, identify exactly what I need to study next."

8. The Simplification Master:

"Take this complex explanation [paste text] and rewrite it so a 10-year-old could understand it perfectly."

9. Memory Palace Builder:

"Help me create a vivid story connecting these [facts/formulas/vocab words] so I never forget them."

10. Progress Accelerator:

"I know [current knowledge]. Design 3 challenging projects that will push me to the next level in [skill/subject]."

The game-changer? These prompts adapt to ANY subject.

I've used them for:

Python programming

French cooking techniques

Digital marketing strategies

Guitar music theory

Even learning chess openings

Pro tip: Follow up each response with "Give me 3 follow-up questions to deepen my understanding."
